## Milestone 1 Feedback 
Great job here outlining your purpose, audience, goal, persona, and use case in clear detail. Having these criteria  specified with a narrow focus now in the conception stage of the project will help us plan an effective Minimum Viable Product.

Your project is set up correctly, but there are some issues with your HTML. See Edits and Suggestions below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

~~I would like to see your Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona, and Use Case expanded and more clearly defined. I definitely want to see your goal for your website outlined, along with the goal of your end user. Please see the PWP Sample Document as a guide. We need to establish defined goals and an appropriate scope for this project. Do you want this website to grow in the future?~~

~~Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier I. Add some more content and expand upon the Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona, and Use Case and I'll pass this Milestone at Tier II.~~

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Don't forget to include the `alt` attribute on your &lt;img&gt; tags. This is required.
- Your new content (Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona and Use Case) should not be inside the &lt;footer&gt; tag, but up in the &lt;section&gt; tag. This would be semantic and structurally proper.
