## Milestone 1 Feedback 
Great job here outlining your purpose, audience, goal, persona, and use case in clear detail. Having these criteria  specified with a narrow focus now in the conception stage of the project will help us plan an effective Minimum Viable Product.

Your project is set up correctly, but there are some issues with your HTML. See Edits and Suggestions below.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

~~I would like to see your Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona, and Use Case expanded and more clearly defined. I definitely want to see your goal for your website outlined, along with the goal of your end user. Please see the PWP Sample Document as a guide. We need to establish defined goals and an appropriate scope for this project. Do you want this website to grow in the future?~~

~~Your Milestone 1 passes at Tier I. Add some more content and expand upon the Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona, and Use Case and I'll pass this Milestone at Tier II.~~

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Don't forget to include the `alt` attribute on your &lt;img&gt; tags. This is required.
- Your new content (Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona and Use Case) should not be inside the &lt;footer&gt; tag, but up in the &lt;section&gt; tag. This would be semantic and structurally proper.

## Milestone 2a Feedback
Your site map, content strategy and interaction flow are all well done.

I only see one wireframe for the desktop layout. Looks like there is an error with your second wireframe file. I'm not quite sure what's going on there. So I can only provide feedback for the image file "WireFrame-PWP.svg" at this time.

Think carefully about how you would like to feature your main navigation links on mobile. This will directly impact the way you code your HTML. It's recommended that mobile navigation be tucked away in a collapsed menu. Take a look at examples from around the web to get some ideas.

Plan to include an HTML contact form on your site. This will be PHP driven using Swiftmailer.

Think about working with your wireframes a bit more before you start to code. Remember that your wireframes should be detailed enough to provide you with a guide for your front end development.

We will see how your development is coming along during our mid-development reviews roughly 3 weeks from now. At that time we will make a decision whether to include the language translation functionality. Ideally, I would like to see [Tier III/IV](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) level work and roughly 75% completion on the project before approving the addition of translation functionality.

All in all this is good work. There are some directory structure issues with the project, so please see the "Edits &amp; Suggestions" below. Your milestone 2&alpha; passes at [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on your PWP.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Move your /Media and /css directories inside of /public_html
- the Media directory should be lowercase
