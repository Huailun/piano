## Milestone 1 Feedback 
I would like to see your Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona, and Use Case expanded and more clearly defined. I definitely want to see your goal for your website outlined, along with the goal of your end user. Please see the [PWP Sample Document](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/) as a guide. We need to establish defined goals and an appropriate scope for this project. Do you want this website to grow in the future? 

Your project is set up correctly, and your HTML looks good.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). Add some more content and expand upon the Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona, and Use Case and I'll pass this Milestone at Tier II.

We will be discussing Milestone 2&alpha; in the weeks to come, so hold off on further work until the next phase is covered in class.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Expand upon the Purpose, Audience, Goal, Persona, and Use Case. Go into detail. See the [PWP Sample Document](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/) as a guide.
