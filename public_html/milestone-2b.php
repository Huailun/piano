Learning to play an instrument can help people to gain more concentration and release stress. However, from years of teaching and my personal learning experiences, playing piano is not easy. But, if people can start piano lesson in a right path, it can save tons of time and energy and enjoy the happiness of playing piano. Different with other instruments, piano is self-sufficient. It can create melody and chords at the same time. Also, not like other instruments, people don't need to tune piano every time before they play on it. Piano is very helpful to build good music ears.</p>

								<li class="icon-bar">About me</li>
								<p>Hello, this is Ellen. I have started to play piano at age of five and never stopped ever since. From the freshman year at university, I began to give piano lessons. After getting my bachelor degree in piano performance in Taipei, Taiwan, I worked as a piano teacher and piano accompanist. Later, I received my master degree in both piano performance and piano pedagogy from University of Houston in Houston, Texas. I taught class piano, music fundamentals and music appreciation in a community college at Cypress, Texas. I found that no matter in eastern or western world, there are plenty of people looking for learning piano. As a recent career change to be a web-devloper, I hope to incoporate my previous experiences with the new skill I have learned to help people who are interested in learning piano. </p>
								<li class="icon-bar">About piano</li>
								<p>Like the golden rule of real estate is "Location, Location, Location", the best way to master in piano is "Practice, Practice, Practice". Because of this, one who is interested in starting a piano lesson, pick the right piano is the important first step. The full size of a standard piano is consist of eighty-eight keys. However, an acoustic piano can cost most people an arm and a leg. My suggestion is to get a weighted electronic keyboard with at least 61 keys.After getting a piano,in my opinion, staring from a five-finger position pattern is the most effective way to build a good fundation in piano learning.</p>

										<li>Tempo</li>
								<p>Tempo to music is as important as heart beats to human. Playing music in a steady tempo makes music sound smoothly. Tempo marks of music are in italian. From Larghissimo to Pretissimo means the slowest to the fastest tempo. In another form of expression, tempo can also be marked as BPM - beats per minutes. </p>
								<li>Rhythm</li>
								<p>What forms rhythm is the division of the note's value. There are two ways of dividing note's value, diving by two is used more often than diving by three. The different way of division gives music different feeling in its movement.</p>
