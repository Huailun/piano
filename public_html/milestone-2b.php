					<p class="lead" id="learn">To many people, music is a powerful part in their personal life. Learning to play an instrument can help people to gain more concentration and release stress. However, from years of teaching and my personal learning experiences, playing piano is not easy. But, if people can start their piano lesson in a right path, it can save tons of time and energy and enjoy the happiness of playing piano. Different with other instruments, piano is self-sufficient. It can create melody and chords at the same time. Also, not like other instruments, people don't need to tune their piano every time before they play on it. Piano is also very helpful to build good music ears and understand how music system works.

				<h3>About me</h3>
					<div class="row">
						<div class="col-sm-12">
								<p>Hello, this is Ellen. I have started to play piano at age of five and never stopped ever since. From the freshman year at university, I began to give piano lessons. After getting my bachelor degree in piano performance in Taipei, Taiwan, I worked as a piano teacher and collaborative pianist. Later, I received my master degree in both piano performance and piano pedagogy from University of Houston in Houston, Texas. I taught class piano, music fundamentals and music appreciation in a community college at Cypress, Texas. I found that no matter in eastern or western world, there are plenty of people looking for learning piano. As a recent career change to be a web-developer, I hope to incorporate my previous experiences with the new skill I have learned to help people who are interested in learning piano. </p>
			</div><!--/. container of about me -->
								<h3>About piano</h3>
								<p id="find" class="find_piano"><strong>Find the right piano:</strong><br>Like the golden rule of real estate is "Location, Location, Location", the best way to master in piano is "Practice, Practice, Practice". Because of this, one who is interested in starting a piano lesson, pick the right piano is the important first step. The full size of a standard piano is consist of eighty-eight keys. However, an acoustic piano can cost most people an arm and a leg. My suggestion is to get a weighted electronic keyboard with at least 61 keys.</p>
								<img class="roland" src="images/roland.jpg" alt="keyboard">
								<p id="finger" class="finger_position"><strong>Finger position:</strong><br>While sitting in front of your new piano, in my opinion, staring from the pattern of five-finger position is the most effective way to build a good fundation in piano learning. Because all piano music need ten fingers to work together to create fine music. It is very important to have equal strength of all fingers when playing piano. Working on all fingers as soon as possible will eliminate many potential obstacles in playing.</p>

								<h3>Reading Music</h3>
								<ul>
										<li>Tempo</li>
										<p>Tempo to music is as important as heart beats to human. Playing music in a steady tempo makes music sound smoothly. Tempo marks of music are in italian. From Larghissimo to Pretissimo means the slowest to the fastest tempo. In another form of expression, tempo can also be marked as BPM - beats per minutes. </p>
										<li>Rhythm</li>
										<p>What forms rhythm is the division of the note's value. There are two ways of dividing note's value, diving by two is used more often than diving by three. The different way of division gives music different feeling in its movement.</p>
										<li>Music Notation: Treble Clef, Bass Clef and Staff</li>
										<p>All music notes are built in a five horizontal lines which called a staff. Between five horizontal lines, there are four spaces. The lines and spaces are counted from bottom to top. From first line to fifth line and first space to fourth space. Depending on what type of clef is put at the beginning of the staff(the very left side of staff), the notes has different names between lines and spaces in an alphabetical order from A to G. The most common clefs are treble clef and bass clef. Treble clef starts on the second line of a staff which is a G note and a bass clef starts on the fourth line which indicates a F note.</p>
										<li>Key signatures</li>
										<p>There are fifteen major and fifteen minor keys in a well-tempered tuning system. Different keys add different colors to music. Except C major and a minor, all keys need to be marked with key signatures. Recognize what key the music is written in is essential to make music sound right. There are seven sharps and seven flats in key signature. They come with a fixed order and add up from one to seven. In sharps, the order is FCGDAEB(Father Charles Goes Down And Ends Battle), flats goes with a completely reverse order, BEADGCF(Battle Ends And Down Goes Charles Father). </p>
